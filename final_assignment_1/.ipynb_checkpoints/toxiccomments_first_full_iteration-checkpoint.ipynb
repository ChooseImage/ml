    "#### When to use HashingVectorizer?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using a large dataset for your machine learning tasks and you have no use for the resulting dictionary of tokens, then HashingVectorizer would be a good candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you worry about hash collisions (which is bound to happen if the size of your matrix is too small), then  you might want to stick to CountVectorizer until you feel that you have maxed out your computing resources and it’s time to optimize. Also, if you need access to the actual tokens, then again CountVectorizer is the more appropriate choice.\n",

You can find such comparisons in almost all economy section of country articles, such as that one in Portugal. In other words, some comparisons are appropriate and should not be completely removed. As I say, you reverted all of my edits, so I did agree with some of your edits, which I left out or reworded in an appropriate manner. I do agree with the picky statistics, and removed comparisons in industrial outputs. For all comparisons made, I included reason why it is made, so it is made clear that it is not a POV. Some of your claims are vague, such as \"\"due to its healthy manufacturing base\"\", which clearly points to original research. You have also removed the IMF forecasts without a valid reason, which is clearly appropriate to show where S Korea is heading right now and useful in demonstrating the speed at which it is growing. I do agree to the technology section and removed some comparisons. My point is that you can't remove all the statistics just because you/or some Wikipedia readers think it is making comparisons - achievements should be recognized and the best way to do so is through comparison.

Not to mention the stories I have heard about the tool phoning home to Microsoft on a regular basis. One other strange thing that I have been hearing from my friend about is people going and validating their PC on the Microsoft Download Center to access a downolad.

Contrary to the genuine dialects, the regional varieties are almost identical to the central standard language [\"\"det centrala riksspråket\"\"] in terms of inflection and syntax. Vocabulary is usually also more or less identical, though some local deviations do exist.

That it would be a dialect of only Danish is also extremely speculative, and it should at the very least be classified as simply \"\"East Scandinavian\"\".

      "The article uses both \"\"parent or adult guardian\"\" AND \"\"an adult\"\" to define who is required to accompany a person under the age of 17 (\"\"Children under 17 or those who does not have IDs including state IDs and drivers license are not allowed to attend R-rated movies unaccompanied by an adult.\"\") The distinction is important, as the MPAA site uses only the \"\"parent or adult guardian\"\" terminology and does not substitute \"\"adult\"\" as the requirement for a chaperon (\"\"Children under 17 are not allowed to attend R-rated motion pictures unaccompanied by a parent or adult guardian.\"\" ). I believe the final sentence under R-rating in this article should be either removed (as it doesn't seem to add any add'l information) or changed (to use only \"\"parent or guardian\"\"). Also, describing state IDs or driver's licenses as being needed doesn't appear to be supported by the MPAA definition i.e. if the box-office person and/or usher decides someone's old enough, they're in.

      "Leejc is absolutely right. He did a better job expressing what I tried to say back in June, 2007. But while I agree with his final conclusion, it isn't quite the right argument to use, that \"\"we must assume the worst,\"\" to get it. So I thought I would try once again to explain how the different wordings of this problem, that seem to say the same thing, can lead to different solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ultimate cause of confusion is the math-specific definition of the term \"\"event.\"\" When a random experiment produces a result, that result is not called an \"\"event,\"\" it is an \"\"occurrence.\"\" \"\"Event\"\" is defined to be the subset of all possible occurrences that have some defining common property. So if I flip a coin a hundred times, there are only two possible events: \"\"heads\"\" and \"\"tails.\"\" There will most likely be about fifty occurrences of each event; and each occurrence will fit into only one event.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I draw a card from a standard deck of playing cards, there are lots of possible events and/or occurrences. Some of them overlap. They include \"\"black card,\"\" \"\"spade,\"\" \"\"honor card (TJQKA),\"\" \"\"Ace,\"\" and \"\"Ace of Spades.\"\" The occurrence \"\"black card\"\" can be in the event \"\"spade\"\" or \"\"club\"\" as well. Note that an occurrence can fit into other events, but not vice versa. An occurrence of \"\"spade\"\" is also an occurrence of \"\"black card,\"\" but the event \"\"spade\"\" is most definitely not the event \"\"black card.\"\" Since determining probabilities involves counting the number of elements in events, the difference can be crucial when less specific observations are applied.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a famous problem that isolates this difference between an occurrence and an event. It is called Bertrand's Box Paradox Suppose you have three indistinguishable boxes, each with two indistinguishable drawers. Inside each drawer is a coin. Box #1 has two gold coins, Box #2 has two bronze coins (I can't resist the temptation to use the initials B and G), and Box #3 has one of each. You pick a box at random, and open a drawer at random. If the coin is gold, what are the odds that the coin in the box's other drawer is also gold (i.e., that it is Box #1)?\n",
      "\n",
      "The first issue here, common to story problems, is that this problem describes an occurrence, not an event. We must extrapolate what the possible outcomes of the actions are, to define the event (the set of possible occurrences) that defines the conditional probability.\n",
      "\n",
      "The incorrect approach to Bertrand's Box Paradox is to say that you narrowed the identity of the box to two possibilities, Box #1 and Box #3. That the \"\"event\"\" matches the observation \"\"the box has at least one gold coin.\"\" This is wrong because there are other ways to describe occurrences in that event. If you pick box #3, then no matter which drawer you open, the occurrence is in the event \"\"the box has at least one gold coin.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The correct approach is to define the event as the set of all possible occurrences where you open a drawer with a gold coin. Every possible occurrence that is consistent with the problem description is in this event (remember, it's a set), and every possible element of this event is consistent with the problem description. Both of those conditions have to be true for the event set we extrapolate as the condition. This set has three elements, not two. In two of those three possible occurrences, the box's other coin is gold. The correct answer is 2/3.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have seen a variation of Bertrand's Box Paradox used to represent the Boy or Girl Paradox. You are the organizer of a neighborhood swim meet. During the meet, you get a phone call from Mr. Smith, who is delayed and can't pick up his children after the meet. He says \"\"Tell my two kids to go home with a neighbor. Their names are Sarah and...\"\" and the phone connection goes dead. There are four families of two children in the meet, and they conveniently include the four possibilities BB, BG, GB, and GG. What are the odds that Mr. Smith has two daughters?\n",
      "\n",
      "This occurrence can be described as \"\"a two-child family includes at least one girl.\"\" But not the event you need to use as the condition. Mr. Smith could have mentioned a boy's name first; and if that boy had a sister, that occurrence would have been an element of the set \"\"a two-child family includes at least one girl.\"\" So that event fails one of the two criteria. You get the answer 1/3 by erroneously using this event.\n",
      "\n",
      "The correct event is just that Mr. Smith mentioned that he had a daughter, and compares to \"\"you opened a drawer with a gold coin\"\" in the Box Paradox. You can count four possible occurrences of that event. In two of those four, representing a single family, Sarah has a sister. The correct answer is 2/4, or 1/2.\n",

      "Actually, most of the romance words in English come from Norman French, abit removed from French (especially modern French). Then there is another grouping of Latinate words which came in via the Grammar school boys (Grammar schools of the late medieval being schools which taught latin grammar, and which required students to speak grammar at all times), and the ecclesiastical coinages, from around the same period (late Tudor England onwards). The first lot, the Norman French, had a rather different historical journey from the second lot, the second lot being rather closer to Classical Latin (actually most are Church or Medieval latin, but the difference here is not so great). The Norman French borrowings have a little more fanciness than regular Germanic English because Norman French was the language of the English ruling class (and law etc) for about 300 years. Most the food words come through this path. The second group (borrowed in from about 1400 to 1700) are fancy not so much because they represent the ruling classes, but because they represent learning. Then there's a few other words which come in from other places, like Piano (from Italtian), and others which are similar because they actually come from a common germanic/italic root even a proto-Indo-European root.\n",

      "On a second related point, the Germanic in English comes from several dialects, from both the North Germanic group (Norse) and the West Germanic. Old English had a few differing dialects. Northern English dialects tend to have a little more Norse and a little less Anglo-saxon, than the south-east. There are Norse and Saxon cognates which both made it into English, skirt and shirt being the famous examples. So, again some more information regarding the exact derivation of the Germanic, unless someone wants to go the whole hog and put in the proto-Germanic reconstructions. But that probably cannot be done. 14:17, 15 July 2007\n",

      "This is how the statement read before you edited it:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"Since a fan creates its cooling effect by speeding the evaporation of moisture on human skin, its perceived usefulness is directly correlated with the amount of humidity (moisture) in the room. In dry environments, such as desert climates, a fan has a lesser perceived usefulness than in humid environments; this is especially notable during cold weather, where a humid environment has a pronounced wind-chill effect which is lacking in dry environments.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "You said, in your edit summary, to refer to the heat index article. So I did. The introductory paragraph to that article reads:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"The human body normally cools itself by perspiration, or sweating, in which the water in the sweat evaporates and carries heat away from the body. However, when the relative humidity is high, the evaporation rate of water is reduced. This means heat is removed from the body at a lower rate, causing it to retain more heat than it would in dry air.\"\"\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "...thus proving that my original statement in my ceiling fan article was correct. In humid climates, heat is naturally removed from the body at a lower rate than in dry climates, causing a person to remain hotter longer than in dry climates. Thus, there is a greater need for a fan than in desert climatesthus it is perceived as being more useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw, via your userpage, that you've grown up in New York. I'm originally from the east coast myself, and I lived here my whole life save for two years in Utaha very distinct desert climate. The lack of humidity out there is actually quite a pleasure. In the summer there, it can be 105 degrees and feel no hotter than 85 here on the east coastyou look at the thermometer there and say \"\"Wow, I didn't realize it's over 100this isn't that uncomfortable!\"\". I wasn't dying for a fan there, the way I do here. Also, the converse is truethe winters out there are more bearable than they are here.

I don't even think the original article even had those terms and if it did, it would be POV. You want to post 7 paragraphs of a story (MUCH OF IT PLAGIARIZED) that is attributed to Abdul Rahman by some person who learned from some other person who claims to be the grandson of the sister of a man that the sister has not seen for decades and who lives in a country they have no access to??? ABSOLUTELY LUDICROUS. The Haaretz's source (Mizrahi) isn't exactly an authority source on Abdul Rahman's life, family sources in Yemen are more credible, but the best source is an autobiography or written biography by someone who knew him. If you want to write 7 paragraphs on his life story, then it should be from a credible, reliable, verified story. If you want to write 7 paragraphs on an unverified, faulty allegation (believed to be refuted with a reasonable argument supported by evidence)then you can guarantee that I will keep reverting you until you realize exactly what kind of mockery you are trying to force happen here. I am treating the allegation as an allegation and you are treating the allegation as if it is his true life story. Your motives are not of good faith.\n",

As the Definitions section of this article suggests, not everyone will be happy with any single term.  For examples, Jennifer Diane Reitz refers to \"\"transsexuality\"\" and Lynn Conway refers to \"\"transsexualism.\"\"  If you search \"\"transsexuality\"\" and \"\"transsexualism\"\" on Google, you will find more hits for \"\"transsexualism.\"\"  Reality Resources, an ex-trans ministry, frequently uses \"\"transsexuality,\"\" and to me, \"\"transsexuality\"\" sounds like a sexual orientation.  Of course, some people do not like either of these terms.  For example, some people prefer Benjamin's syndrome [], but that definitely sounds like a disease.  Andrea James has proposed the term \"\"interest in feminization\"\" for transsexual women who plan to transition.  She feels like that term would encompass all persons who transition from male to female, or desire to do so, including those who do so for non-traditional reasons.  While I do not feel like the medical community should stop people from transitioning for non-traditional reasons, I also feel like this terminology suggests that transsexualism is a chosen behavior.  I feel that transsexualism is an inborn characteristic, but I don't believe that it should be called a disease.  All said, I feel like Transsexualism is the best title for the Wikipedia article on the subject.  Given the recent replies to this comment, and the recent move debate, I feel like consensus has already been established.\n",

      "Paul Siebert - The main contribution of the FCM 36 was the sloped armor on all sides, with the slope of the hull continuous with the turret, so that the tank ended up with a pyramidal shape and a very small turret.   This was exactly the same shape of the T-34 which appeared some 3-4 years later than the FCM 36 and yet the T-34 gets all the credit and accolades as a \"\"revolutionary design\"\" for its sloped armor.   Well, the French came up with that idea first (p. 247-248 in T-34 Mythical Weapon).    Michulec goes further and points out that the pyramidal shape was highly impractical as it resulted in a tiny turret that was all but nonfunctional as the two crewmen could barely aim, load, and fire the gun.  This was why the initial \"\"flat turret\"\" with the steeply sloped sides was replaced by the slightly larger, and less steeply sloped \"\"hexagonal turret\"\" (p. 245).   The later T-34-85 turret was hardly sloped at all in order to maximize space to fit the larger gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for your point about the dysfunctionality of the T-34-76, the early T-34-76 models were the most dysfunctional because of their tiny, steeply sloped turrets and the weak L-11 gun.  The larger hexagonal turret, which was designed to allow for installation of the more powerful F-34 gun was much more functional, but it was still a two man turret lacking a commander.  That problem was not fixed until early 1944 when the T-34-85 finally rolled off the production lines with a three man turret.  The T-34-76 models thus ALL shared this problem of having nearly blind crewmen trying to fight on the battlefield.  The Germans found it very easy to pick them off like ducks because the tank crews had a very limited field of vision, and no way to communicate with other tanks.  There is a description in Healy's Zitadelle  of an episode at the Battle of Kursk where the Soviet T-34s were charging in  and the Germans would just leisurely pick off the T-34s one by one, with all the surviving T-34s completely oblivious to the mass destruction around them.  That was in July 1943.   Michulec's book does show that the Soviets started installing a commanders cupola on the hexagonal turret in the summer of 1943 (p. 123).  Probably learned something from the heavy losses of the Battle of Kursk that the tank crews needed to be able to see what was going on around them.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Michulec points out that the tank that the Germans most likely did fear and have a lot of trouble with was the KV-1.  The KV-1 had the really tough armor that was resistant to the early German guns (the T-34's thin side armor could be penetrated by the weak guns of the German tanks of 1941) and it had the three man crew that made it a formidable fighting machine on the battlefield.    The T-34-76 crews could simply not see well enough and function inside that tiny turret well enough to be a serious threat to German tanks.    The problem with the KV-1 of course was twofold - it was very slow and sluggish and did not travel through bad terrain very well, unlike the T-34.  And it carried the name of the later discredited Kliment Voroshilov.   Which is probably why in the Soviet retelling of history, the KV-1 gets only a very brief mention.  All the glory gets heaped on the T-34s, which the Germans had no reason to fear because it was not much of a threat to them on the battlefield, due to its dysfunctional tiny two man turret.  Michulec points out that the German generals, especially Guderian, in all probability confused the KV-1 and T-34 in their memoirs.  \n",

      "DMorpheus - I think you are being a bit harsh with Michulec's book.  But at least you recognize the huge amount of work that he put into this thing.  Yes, the photos and drawings are INCREDIBLE.  I think rather than calling the text \"\"awful\"\", it would be more accurate to describe its two major problems:\n",

      "2. Michulec goes overboard with his obvious anti-Soviet ranting.  Somebody should have just edited all this out, and it would have made the book more professional.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, if you are able to slug through the difficult translation and filter out the anti-Soviet bias, what you find is that Michulec has packed his book chock full of facts, and he does reference most of his major facts.  Unfortunately those references all seem to be in Russian or Polish or German.   But I think that is where this book shines over books by Zaloga.    \n",

As far as I know, however, Plant said \"\"my mother was a gypsy\"\", where \"\"gypsy\"\" could've meant \"\"a traveller\"\" or a \"\"a hippie\"\" - in terms of a lifestyle, not ethnicity. He could've meant some Itinerant groups in Europe like for instance the Irish Travellers or maybe some Scottish Gypsy and Traveller groups. I know Robert Plant is from the UK, and I've heard that British people usually don't use the word \"\"gypsy\"\" when speaking about Romani people, but they use it when speaking about people who lead itinerant life. Any conformation that Plant used it in terms of his Romani ethnic origin?   \"\n",

I knwo this list has been kept short by agreement way back, so i'm putting this topic here to allow people to discuss which prophets should be listed, if any, and how many.  I believe there's a more comprehensive list elsewhere in the Baha'i articles which mention Hud, the prophet to the Sabeans, Noah, etc. all prophets that would have to go into a full list of \"\"prophets accepted by Baha'is\"\".

The best way to do this would be to tag the original webpage with the license that it is being released under.

      "I'm doing some bits of minor copyediting and am stuck on this sentence, from the Navigation section: The use of steamboats along the river, beginning in 1850... There is a footnote, to this timeline page, which phrases it \"\"1850: Steamboats Columbia and Lot Whitcomb begin regular service on the Columbia River.\"\" The thing is there were steamboats in regular service on the river before 1850, at least to Fort Vancouver. The first was the Beaver (steamship), which arrived at Ft Vancouver in 1836. I thought about rewording the sentence The regular use of steamboats along the river..., but that isn't quite right either because the Beaver was in \"\"regular use\"\", even if its operations were not limited to the river. Anyway, I can't come up with a way to reword this bit, especially given the existence of the footnote, which does not mention the Beaver. So I'm just mentioning it here. It is a minor point to be sure, but symptomatic of an unfortunate US bias present in many history books and web pages.   \"\n",

      "“The study of how living organisms become fossilized is known as taphonomy.  … From the moment an organism dies, there is a tremendous loss of information as it decays and is trampled, tumbled, and broken before it is buried.  The more of that lost information that we can reconstruct, the more reliable our scientific hypotheses are likely to be.  ….  From the original complete assemblage of living organism, known as a ‘life assemblage” or biocenosis, many events occur that screen out certain organisms, leaving a much smaller death assemblage, or thanatocenosis.  The process of breakup and decay of organism immediately after death is known as necrolysis. \n",
      "\n",
      "“After a death assemblage accumulates, many other factors operate on the hard parts to break them up and scatter them around, so an even smaller percentage ends up buried for future fossilization.  These processes occur after necrolysis and are known as biostratinomy.  These agents of destruction can be biological, mechanical, or chemical.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Biological agents are the most important factor in most environments, both marine and terrestrial.  Both predators and scavengers are very active in breaking up shells and bones ….  In summary, the key factor that prevents biological destruction is rapid burial.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For those organism that are not buried right away:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mechanical agents of destruction such as wind, waves, and currents can be very important.  These processes are most effective in shallow waters, where both waves and storm have their highest energies.  … In summary, the shape, density, and thickness of the bone or shell are the most important factors in determining survival under mechanical transport [until burial].”\n",
      "\n",
      "“After burial a variety of digenetic [chemical] changes in the rock can easily destroy shells.  … In summary, the original composition and the groundwater chemistry are the most important factors in determining whether digenetic changes are likely to alter or dissolve a fossil.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Taphonomic research has come a long way since the pioneering studies of the 1960s and 1970s.  Paleontologists can no longer afford to naively take the fossil record at face value, but must always keep in mind the taphonomic “noise” that may obscure the original biological ‘signal’.”\n",

      "“The processes outlined above account for most fossilization and what we know of the living organism is usually quite incomplete.  However, there are extraordinary fossil deposits around the world that preserve soft tissues and sometimes even skin texture and color patterns. … These are known as Lagerstatten (German for “mother lode”), and they have produced some of the most important fossils known.  … From all these examples, several general trends emerge.  The best fossilization occurs when there is rapid burial and anoxic conditions to prevent scavenging, no reworking currents and little or no digenetic alteration to destroy the fossils.”\n",

I have often heard Jack speak, pointing out that the dinosaurs of Montana were almost all killed and buried by catastrophic river floods near the shore of the inland sea that is now Eastern Montana, the Dakotas and related Canadian States.  The bones and the geology both acclaim to that.  Of course, these floods are considered local in extant.  This same theme is echoed on many signs and posters through out the museum.\n",

The modern \"\"theory\"\" of a \"\"long-count\"\" was mostly derived in the late 1880's from one of three surviving Maya codices, namely the Dresden Codex.

As for your request for clearing out your name, I really don't know how to help? I mean, you are obviously in some quarrel with REX, I really don't know how to help there - you should probably both stop it, (regardless who's started it) and try to find a solution according to the NPOV policy. I have already stated my POV on the Arvanites dispute - I might be wrong, but it is probably better for me to stay away from the dispute. I think that REX's current version is quite OK. It includes what the vast majority linguists say: Arvanitika, is a variety of Tosk Albanian, and Arvanites' sensitivity towards the problem: Most Arvanites strongly dislike being called Albanians. I mean, it's not like saying that Arvanites are ethnic Albanians. For example: I cannot dispute the fact that most sources in the past referred to the Macedonian language, as a Bulgarian or a Serbian dialect, despite the fact that I believe that they were seriously wrong, and therefore there is nothing wrong with this sentence: Most sources in the past regarded Macedonian as a subset of the Bulgarian and Serbian language.\n",

      "None of this is my point of view, because I am simply talking about facts and events that really happened. Yes those bands were real in the 90's, and yes they played what is really emo. Then the mainstream caught ahold of it and ruined it by plugging bands like SDRE and Weezer that had nothing to do with it. That's what really happened. Why would there not be countless tales of this happening? Because the mainstream media, the only people that can put out articles in the mid-90's before the internet buzz, never heard of the damn word until those kind of popular bands started having it associated with their name. \"\"Oh emo, that must be emotional right?

      "\n",
      "- \"\"Secondly, there is Wiki policy that articles dealing with American topics have American English spellings, and articles about British stuff have British English spellings. If White House has British spellings in it, by all means change them to the US ones.\"\"\n",
      "    \n",
      " I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to tell me here, but my guess is that you assume that I don't know about the current Wikipolicy, and that you obviously don't understand what I clearly stated. I am arguing that Wikipedia should either have ALL British spelling, or ALL standard English spelling (a.k.a - \"\"American english), but preferabally standard English because this isn't a British website, and because as an encyclopedia, all the information should be unified under one context and/or dialect.\n",
      "\n",
      "- My point wasn't \"\"British are the only people that use British spelling.\"\" (although in a literal sense, this is a strong point outside of context), it was that \"\"The majority of the English speaking population use Standard English.\"\". If I seemed to use the former point, then either the way you interpreted my words was wrong, or I misworded my intentional argument. If I did, then my apologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"\"But every other English-speaking country used the standard spelling, which is generally based on how the word actually sounds\"\" \n",
      "Again, you missed a subtle point that changed the entire meaning of my words. See the word generally? What I mean by this, if you can't already comprehend, is that many words in the British spelling include silent letters. Here's an example of one: pAEdophile. If one trys to pronounce this word by the letters, it would sound something like \"\"PAH-EHD-OH-FILE\"\", adding an extra syllable, when it's really pronounced \"\"PE-DOH-FILE\"\", which pretty much follows how the Standard English form is spelled. \n",
      "\n",
      "- I'm not very new to Wiki, and if that's a subtle way for you to try to undermind my intelligence, then I resent that statement. And again, do not take my words as rants. Anybody who understands the inherent nature of an encyclopedia understands that this is an important issue.

      "Why would Palpatine propagate his deformation by continuing to generate Force lightning? Some argue that he purposely disfigured himself to use as evidence against the Jedi in the Senate, and that given his personality, he wouldn't really mind the changes. How can one make such a presumption though? He's pure evil, we really don't know much else about him character wise. That's also part of what makes him so great, he's little more than evil personified... the Dark Side of the Force incarnate. Its far more likely that he looked like that before, the Dark Side corrupting his features over time. That would explain why his face looks perfectly symmetrical as a side effect of Dark Side abuse, rather than truely \"\"warped\"\" all in one shot. Remember, Lucas didn't create Palpatine in ROTJ thinking, \"\"He's human, and he looks so hideous because Mace Windu played by Samuel L. Jackson in Revenge of the Sith demanded a larger role and wanted to claim responsibility for something important.\"\" When approached with a question asking him why the Emperor looks the way he does sometime after the release of ROTJ, Lucas answered that it was a side-effect of utilizing the Dark Side for so long over one's lifetime. He specifically likened it to cancer. They were originally going to make the change gradual over the course of the prequal trilogy, as exemplified by AOTC. As you can see, all of the makeup that made him look older in AOTC was not present in ROTS. Reason? Samuel L. Jackson. He had to whine and complain about having an impact and not getting killed by Clone Troopers like all of the other Jedi. George got him to shut up by having a not-so-noble death, and having it look like he beat Palpatine in a duel (specific quotes from Nick Gillard in the Making Of Revenge of the Sith book indicate that Palpatine acted the whole thing out, PERIOD. He even stressed it to the point where he suggested Ian add, \"\"SUCKER!\"\" to the his dialogue) Yeah right, all of the smart fans know better. Alright so Mace was duped, but Samuel was obviously pacified. Di Mace still make an impact? In a way, he did. He revealed the galaxy the true face of Lord Sidious\"\n",

But this is actually 'Step 2' of gematria(74). 'Step 1' of gematria(8) is simply counting the number of letters in a word/name/phrase. Because of Latin Numerals not coinciding with their place in the Latin Alphabet, i.e. I does not = 1, Latin Gematria never gave much importance to Step 2 of gematric sum. But the learned Romans and other learned practioners of Latin did recognize Step 1 of counting the Latin letters and giving significance to it. This example of counting the number of letters and giving it importance and can be traced back to Plato's use of \"\"God is ever a geometer\"\", which in Greek - equals 3,1,4,1,5,9 or 3.14159 pi. - Brad Watson, Miami, FL 64.136.26.22  \"\n",

      " Further, Dodo violated WP rules, by not allowing a consensus of the group to develop.  He also misapplied a rule, claiming that something I said must be 'verifiable'.  But what does it mean, to be 'verified'?  Dodo implied that what I said must be verifiably, scientifically TRUE.  I claim, quite to the contrary, that since the article involved is 'Jim Bell' (subject, ME), that the only 'verifiability' issue is this:  Did 'James Dalton Bell' ACTUALLY make these claims.  (Or, conversely and hypothetically, 'is someone else forging his identity?, etc.)   For example, there was no need to RUSH and delete my posts.  Rather, somebody (preferably, one familiar with LOGIC) could have said, \"\"Bell, how do we know that 'you', 'jimdbell@q.com', is in fact the 'jim bell' (James Dalton Bell) who is the subject of the 'Jim Bell' WP article?  We need to be able to VERIFY the fact that 'jim bell' actually said/did this.\"\" (To ensure that 'jim bell' is not being libelled by a stealth forgery.)\n",
      "In response, I would have immediately said, \"\"Good question!\"\"  And I could have promptly proceeded to do whatever was necessary to establish this fact.  Perhaps I could also have donated a recent (current!) photograph to the article, which (of course) could be compared with other published (even if not public domain) photographs which are available on the web.   \n",
      "But as John Belushi was so fond of saying, 'BUT NOOOOOOOOOOO!'  Rather than HELP a 'newbie' (to WP), AND wait for a consensus, and actually help VERIFY that 'jimdbell@q.com' is actually, 'jim bell', Dodo decided to be an ass and repeatedly delete my edits.  And, he deleted ALL my edits, not merely some portion which (allegedly) was not 'verifiable'.  I will give an example, to the contrary:  I also posted a claim that I accused the Feds of forgery in a criminal appeal case, 99-30210.  In fact, in June 2003 I wrote a lawsuit (195 pages) which has (I believe) LONG been posted on the Web.  (Probably Cryptome/JYA).  It (as I recall) makes exactly this accusation.  So, if Dodo had actually acted INTELLIGENTLY, he would have edited my edit to cite my lawsuit, which has been posted for perhaps 5+ years.  (Or, he would have said to me, \"\"Bell, you need to show a cite of your lawsuit...\"\").  THAT would have been productive, useful, and helpful.  (As opposed to being hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.)   So, why didn't Dodo do THAT?!?   The answer is quite simple:  Dodo is hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.  He's a 'control freak'.  (Apparently, WP attracts 'control freaks'.)  Rather than being assisting, supportive, and helpful, Dodo wants to slap around newbies who upset his apple cart.\n",

I think that the best way to go would be to upload them to the commons, put captions on them, and place them under the proper headings (here I would also suggest you ask a more experienced art editor than I, someone like Wetman, Caravaggisti, Ewulp, or Celithimus, for their adviceyou will find their contributions throughout the histories of artists' entries... maybe they'll say I'm all wrong). The other option is to continue placing pictures in articles, but even when there are a lot of them, I actually hate deleting images once they are up, either because of my own reticence in undoing what others have done, or out of respect for the visual image. That being said, if there is any way I can help, I would be glad to. It is clear that you have a great collection of photos, and that you are very generous. Best regards,\n",

Call me crazy.  Anyway, first I added a subheading and also put a mention in the opening paragraph.  I acknowledge that adding it to the opening paragraph was probably overkill, but doesn't this incident at least deserve its own sub-heading?  I challenge you to find the mention of the killings in the current article.  It is very difficult to find without reading the entire article.  And how many times in modern history have people in the USA been killed so they could be eaten?  I suggest to you that this is a noteworthy and highly unusual event.  Anyway, I will stop now.  Thanks again.\"\n",

Early zoom designs typically consisted of three lens groups (convergent,divergent,convergent); the 2d group was fixed, and the 1st and 3rd groups were mobile.  Furthermore, the 1st and 3rd group were rigidly linked, so that a complex and difficult to manufacture non-linear cam-based group distance regulation mechanism wasn't needed.  The downside of the rigid linking was that such a design can limit optical aberrations only over a very limited focal length range.\n",

I therefore think that mentioning the instrumental case, and the fact that there were more different endings in OHG than in modern High German is interesting enough to merit a section.

      "\n",
      "One of the main rights of humans, as well as countries is the right to freely choose its name.  One of the biggest insults for me is when somebody is trying to change the name of another one.  This time I will not respond to the insults posted by User:Makedonas, User:Nestore and User:Vergina because the language they are using is unacceptable for a serious site like Wikipedia (Just to quote the last comment by User:Makedonas: This is a country which was a part of Jugoslavia,where a lot of people are Albanians,where they speak a bulgarian dialekt,and they want to have a greek name)!!!???. \n",
      "For me it is very difficult to understand the offensive position of Greeks trying to change the name of its neighboring country, so I will try to dig in the history and in the recent events in order to find an answer why Greece is doing this.\n",
      " History: Undisputable fact is that modern Greeks have very little common with the ancient Macedonians, even with the ancient Greeks!  Actually, all modern nations living in the Balkan Peninsula are modern nations created with mixing the old nations like ancient Greeks, ancient Macedonians, Ilirs etc with the modern Greeks, Slavic population etc.  For example, the most dominant opinion in our country is that the modern Macedonian nation is created as mixture of ancient Macedonians and Slavic population.  Probably the Modern Greek nation has origin from the ancient Greeks and ancient Macedonians, but that doesn’t give him a right to claim ownership of the name Macedonia.\n",
      " Another interesting fact is that the name Macedonia was virtually forbidden for use in Greece before seventies in the last century.  Actually, the northern part of Greece was called “Northern Greece”. Meantime, Greeks realized that they can benefit more if they adopt the name of Macedonia. Starting from that point, the northern part of Greece was renamed to Macedonia and many shops, airports, streets etc got the Macedonian name.  So, Greece is using the name Macedonia for its northern part for 30 years, but Republic of Macedonia is using its name officially from 1945 (that is 60 years)!\n",
      " One of the biggest fears of Greece is its Macedonian minority. It is known that a large population of Greece claim Macedonian ethnicity. Actually, during the Civil war in Greece from 1945-1949 a real genocide of the Macedonian population took place there.  Many of the Macedonian people were tortured and expelled from their homes.  Nowadays Greece doesn’t recognize the Macedonian minority and forbids the use of Macedonian language, culture, education etc.\n",
      " Very interesting fact is the following: Luxembourg and Belgium are neighboring countries. Belgium has a province which is called LUXEMBOURG! So far, Belgium never disputed that.  In our situation, Greece has a province called Macedonia, but aggressively disputes the right of our country to use its name.\n",
      " Greece claims that Macedonia has pretensions over Greek territories. Even if that is true, Greece is several times stronger than Macedonia economically, politically, military etc, so it is really hard to believe that Macedonia can harm Greece, especially by using the name Macedonia.\n",

Further, the lead contains the phrase \"\"...though no evidence exists to suggest any of these reports are true\"\"  This seems to be undue to me. The source could not find any evidence. Ok. But this does not mean that no evidence exists. There may be evidence which this source could not find/does not know about. Moreover, Sian does not seem to have made much of an effort to find evidence and proving/disproving evidence was not the objective of that source. Sian seems to be trying to find a psychological/anthropological type of explanation for the \"\"forced conversion\"\" narrative and has explained it in those terms. So, using this source to say no evidence exists seems inappropriate. Moreover, the \"\"Scope\"\" section contains the proclamation \"\"...(though in the UK it has been proven false)\"\"  This is misleading because the source is about forced conversion among Sikhs in UK and is not about forced conversion in UK as a whole.

It seems like there were a few other admins who came on that ANI board after I had been blocked and were the first ones to actually discuss the true issue, i.e. evidence of views expressing a systematic bias being a problem with objectivity when an article's deletion is at stake. It seems like that other user was the baiter and then, being the first to complain (I don't even know how), he got what he wanted, and I had no chance for appeal. This was an especially dirty trick since this happened as the election of which the subject of the article was a candidate's results were being announced and, had he won, I would've wanted to (and been in the best position to) update his article accordingly. Thank you for the somewhat quick and painless resolution, but this whole experience has left me pretty upset with this blocking procedure. It should not have been done so quickly like I was some anonymous IP (been editing for over 6 years, have created dozens of articles) and I should have had a chance to appeal, or at least get judged on the merits of the issue, not just on what kind of grease the squeakiest wheel wanted.\n",

Neither Carl, son of Canute, nor his father Canute, son of Tord (no English version of that one is known to me), ever used the Bonde surname. It became a surname, and that of one of Sweden's longest living \"\"noble\"\" families (still going strong) around the end of the 16th century. Only the nobility started using surnames then. NO ONE (excuse me for shouting) had any surnames until then in Sweden, though some regular soldiers had nicknames to distinguish them from all the other Anders Anderssons. 80% of the population had no surnames at all, other than new patromymics inherited every generation, until they began adopting them in the 1880's.

Windows XP is in the unique position - compared to all other Windows releases I can think of - of being at the convergence point of two separate Windows product lines, that of Windows NT and the old, MS-DOS-based Windows 9x. However, the core code in XP is based on the former and not the latter (hence XP has an internal version number of 5.1, while Windows 2000 has one of 5.0 - among numerous other things). A list of every single feature included in Windows ME (the last of the MS-DOS based versions) but not in XP would be quite long indeed, and also quite pointless, because it would be comparing operating systems of two very different architectures.

Also, Magic should NOT be listed as a point forward.  He is a big point guard, and played as a big point guard. and guarded other point guards.    The Showtime Lakers has Michael Cooper, James Worthy, and Byron Scott starting at shooting guard and small forward, putting Magic at point guard.  Most other point forwards (particularly Pippen and anyone who would qualify in today's game) still have actual point guards on the floor with them, though the ball handling is reduced and they're often combo guards(think Ron Harper, Boobie Gibson, Delonte West).

      "Editor  made the change from \"\"severed\"\" to \"\"cut in two\"\".  \"\"Cut in two\"\" is actually more accurate, and his explanation was also correct.  \"\"Severed\"\" *isn't* quite correct.  I realize that there was a book on Short published under the title, \"\"Severed\"\" (it's in my library, in fact).  But, if you look closely at the definition of \"\"sever\"\", Short's body wasn't really severed, it was cut in two.  Definition of \"\"sever\"\" from Webster's: to put or keep apart  divide; especially  to remove (as a part) by or as if by cutting.  To put or keep apart is accurate when referring to people who have severed relationships.  Divide; especially  to remove (as a part)... doesn't fit what happened to Short's body, because her body wasn't divided into parts but actually bisected.  With all of this in mind, I think that if \"\"severed\"\" is insisted on and kept, the words, \"\"in two\"\" need to be added.  I will be making that addition after I am finished with this talk page entry.  More discussion here would be a good thing.  Thanks.    \"\n",

The testicle cuffs extended between the legs, and each man was connected to the next by a rope between their genitals. These tight metal bindings on their scrotums were to ensure that a quick pace was kept, for if a man were to stop walking the rope would pull and cause quick, sharp pain in the genital region. doesn't sound vaguely historical, source it or I'll remove it.\n",

      "- As somebody else said, the \"\"nation of Transylvania\"\" DOES NOT EXIST, it is pure ROMANIA and Romanians! Therefore, we will tell some real history here. Within the chronicles of Herodotus , one may find that he described the Dacians(Getae) as the nation living within the present Romanian and Moldavian territory, including the part that is called Transylvania today, which means “beyond the forests”, after the Latin definition given by Romans and which consisted of the Carpathian Mountains and the Pannonian Plains. A more accountable map can be found here: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Dacia_82_BC.png .. Therefore, the nation living there consisted of dacians, which were known as Geton (plural Getae) in Greek writings, and as Dacus (plural Daci) and Getae in Roman documents. The dacians were conquered, after great efforts, by the Romans and Dacia was transformed into a Roman Province. Following, it was  a period of Romanization, period when the main Romanian people rose. As an answer to the Magyar origin, the history says that their starting point within the actual Hungary is related to the invasion of the Mongols ruled by Genghis Han and the Huns ruled by Attila within the European territory. After their settlement within the Pannonian Plains, the Hungarian people emerged, by mixing with the local populations. As a clear conclusion, one may say that nobody can contradict the written past or the great historians in terms of the origin of Dacians and the territory within they lived, called today Transilvania/Transylvania. The truth that has to be admitted is that Dacians/Getae were here as a nation BEFORE the Hungarian people came over and rose as a nationality. Moreover, NEITHER the Mongols and Huns NOR the actual Hungarians WERE here BEFORE the Romanization of Dacians, therefore they were not present before the emerging stage of the Romanian people. International history admits that the Hungarians appeared within today’s Hungary territory around the 9th century A.C. (according to Britannica) as an immigrating people coming from the actual Tibet region/Mongolia. After settlement they conquered Transilvania and nowadays they fabricate they were first to live on this land. Bear in mind that Romanians will never stop claiming their internationally admitted origin, dating from Daco-Romans times and they will never stop viewing Trasilvania as their own home! If the Hungarians want to live without conflicts, they should stop claiming what does not belong to them, the Transylvania land. PEACE! \n",

      "The idea behind the template is pretty simple.  The basic idea is that every article should have the following, unless there is some reason to the contrary:\n",

      "The \"\"See also\"\" section should include a link to the List of Korea-related topics  (LKRT), and anything else that's obviously relevant but not linked in the article text.  If you prefer, you can just put in the LKRT link and let someone else add the others.  If you want to add more, here's the rule I've been following:  look in each category of which the article is a member.  If that category has a main article (like Korea in Category:Korea), then that main article should be linked  either from the text, or from the See also section.  The same for parent categories, within reason.  Here's an example:  Munmu of Silla is a member of the categories Silla and Korean rulers.  Thus, the articles Silla and Rulers of Korea are linked in the article text.  Those two categories are part of Category:Korean history and Category:Korean people.  Thus, History of Korea is linked in the See also section, and so is List of Koreans (well, it is now).   Both of those are members of Category:Korea, hence the link to the LKRT.  \n",
      "You can find a complete (?) list of Korea-related categories at List of Korea-related topics#Categories.  Or just start at Category:Korea and work your way down.\n",
      "Template:Koreanname noimage is fine for the vast majority of articles.  Cut and paste Template talk:Koreanname noimage#Syntax and fill in the blanks.  All Korean name tables require you to specify at least these four variables: hangul, hanja, rr, and mr.  \"\"Rr\"\" stands for Revised Romanization of Korean, and \"\"mr\"\" stands for McCune-Reischauer Romanization.  If you don't know what should go in these fields, just leave them blank  however, at a minimum the hangul should be provided (that allows other editors to verify the article and identify the other name-related information).

Second, he proposed a mechanism for evolution which he termed natural selection, the idea that organisms can change over the generations if individuals having certain heritable traits leave more offspring than other individuals.  ..In modern terms, we would say that the genetic composition of the population had changed over time, and that is one way of defining evolution.  But we can also use the termin evolution on a much grander scale to mean all of the biological history, from the earliest microbes to the enormous diversity of modern organisms.\n",

Anyway, don't be discouraged.  I've deleted the article you created, and feel free to ask me if you have any more questions.

In fact, I've always said that Chicago was more conservative than a lot of smaller cities in the Great Lakes region (namely Cleveland, Detroit and Milwaukee) if for no other reason than a larger percentage of people who fit into one or more of the categories you named (person of color, union worker, \"\"lakefront liberal,\"\" and I would add bohemian/counter-culturist to the list as well).  \n",

As far as Chicago culture being bland compared to the East and West coasts, you're probably right about that too.  But it's not as if people on the east or west coast don't have their criticism about the other coasts' culture as well.  East Coast people tend to think West Coast culture is too fluffy and superficial and West Coast people think the East Coast is too uptight and high-strung.  So I don't think how Chicago/Great Lakes culture is viewed by people on the coasts shoould really have any bearing on whether or not it's a \"\"coast.\"\"\n",

I think the first thing to do is to make a page entitled \"\"South African Butterflies\"\" or \"\"List of South African Butterflies\"\". I have several caterpillars in my kitchen and am documenting the life cycle (with photos) - I also have a beautiful moth pupa from a bright yellow and black caterpillar. I think it is a hawk moth? I hope to make a page when it has hatched and been photographed, and when I have found information to go with it.  \"\n",

You had brought in your interventions in a macro-cosmical manner during the last two caucuses, which is why I am seeking your opinion before else. If you check Alanya article on wikipedia main page today, you will see that the name is rendered as Alaeddin Keykubad for the first and foremost one. To add an opinionated note, I am expecting little initiative from my fellow Turks on putting the name of an old sultan in correct form, ruminating cattle as many are. All at the same time as holding rather heterodox stances, it had fallen on me to defend the article on the mosque too.

I still feel a little guilty for the way I acted towards you guys, and I want to let you, BMK and MarntteD know that I'm sorry, because I didn't mean to lose my temper. And I didn't mean for those things I said too. So please, I just want to bag from you, please don't report me at all, because I'm sorry. I'm really sorry for the way I acted and I know leaving the wiki won't solve it at all, it will only make it worse for me.

I'm not sure what \"\"edit war\"\" you are referring to, other than my own additions to your page, which you state at the top that you welcome. Your immediate removal of my edit was very suspicious to me, as it seemed pretty authoritative. Are you on the edits to Marmaduke subscription list? I don't understand. I do not think I am acting like a child. If childish behavior to you is using bad language, then call me a a child I suppose. I did not call you any personal names and only referred to what I thought of as a hierarchy on Wikipedia as a \"\"clusterfucked bureaucracy.\"\" I can call your edits an ego trip, which they increasingly seem to be, as you want to talk to me like I am a child, even calling me \"\"childish\"\". It seems as if you didn't even consider the several links I included in my last post, inculding NPR. I am trying to tell you that I made a reasonable edit to a page, one that I made before and which lasted several months before I noticed it was gone tonight. You assertion that \"\"I am willing to bet no one will show you more sympathy than I will\"\" is further proof that this process is an ego trip for you. If users are all equal, than I would prefer it if you left me alone. My edit is not inflammatory, and included a link to the website. If needs be, I can include all of the links I provided on your page if that is enough to validate my claim that marmaduke explained is a relatively popular blog.

In fact, he specifically mentions that he was a \"\"master mariner,\"\" which indicates he was an officer on a warship (yes, the pirate could have been lying regarding his former rank) and that he lost his leg in battle, which would doubtlessly lead to his retirement from active naval service. However, with the skills of a former naval officer (incidentally, who would have been trained in navigation) he would have had an easy time joining up with a pirate crew. (He was likely lying about serving under Captain England given the dates.) Also, Silver was Flint's quartermaster, which in the Royal Navy is the helmsman's position. Given that his one-legged status does not seem to make him any less lethal a pirate  he takes down a man by nailing him in the spine with his crutch!  there is no reason to suppose that he retired from the life of a gentleman of fortune because he had one leg.

      "I'm sorry, I don't understand.  What is the \"\"it\"\" that doesn't make what clear?  The statement that you have kept deleting says that Trent reaffirmed (affirmed again) the then existing teaching that Christian marriage is a sacrament.  The statement does make that clear.  If you want to insert a statement that marriage (like the other sacraments) was not always recognized as a sacrament, find a reliable source that says so and insert it at an appropriate point.  That appropriate point is obviously not the time of Trent, since by then marriage was not only generally recognized in the Church as a sacrament but had even been several times dogmatically declared to be such.  You'd also have to explain the significance you think you see in the fact that in this respect marriage is in no way different from the other sacraments, none of which was or could be recognized as a sacrament until a theology of sacraments was developed.  Isn't that obvious?\n",

Looking into their and some other people's comments, I can also see the benefits of trying to avoid hyperbole and will strive to do so on my own.

As such, I cannot rely on you to interpret \"\"further hurtful hyperbole\"\" in a neutral, balanced fashion and cannot give that undertaking to you. I see that this article sphere is being adminned by a small group of mostly involved admins. That is not how articles spheres are supposed to be adminned. I see this as a failure of Wikipedia adminning process. This article sphere is infamous for various problems and I think rather that eds, the problem is due to the failure of adminning process whereby articles are supposed to be adminned by uninvolved admins, rather than a small group of involved admins. If some admin is taking continuous interest in one particular area of articles, they must be having some kind of involvement/interest in the content in that area. That is not respectable adminning and will clearly lead to problems, as indeed it is here. It creates a situation where eds from only one particular orientation will have paramount power on article content and the eds on the other side will get butchered. I do not think this article sphere has any problems that do not exist in other article spheres. Other admins are being kept away by the continuous propaganda that this sphere is problematic and a small band of involved admins continues to occupy \"\"their turf\"\".

      " I think this is all rather scholastic. The name is admittedly imperfect due to the fact that the article essentially catalogues very recent (by the standards of any encyclopedia) and ongoing events. But the term could be justified: the number 2 therein implies a clear reference to THE Cold War, which evokes unmistakable associations, the prime one being the rivalry exactly between Russia (the USSR) and the US for the global dominance (to put it bluntly). And not just some highly localised and geopolitically irrelevant (unless you watch CNN claptrap on a daily basis) squabble somewhere in the Near East. Russia is the only state that not merely defies the US, but challenges the entire status quo as established post-Cold War, as is clear from Putin's quotes cited in the Background section. There is every sign that he is determined to achieve at least what the USSR had, i.e. dominance over half of the Continental Europe, or to go nuclear in a very literal sense of the term, i.e. obliterating the centres of Western civilisation. This is almost official now. Thus, at the end of the day, Yes, it is about the US vs the RF, as the US is the only military force in NATO to speak of. But the implications thereof are very broad, the phenomenon is nascent, therefore separate article is warranted, I think. We do not know as of now how it is to evolve: it may very well be the case, the appropriate title in a few months will be \"\"THE RUN-UP TO WORLD WAR III\"\".  \"\n",

On the 1872 map, only the upper rim of the South (or lower rim of the Midwest, depending at how one looks at it) received higher influxes of German, and this it is shaded darker than portions further south.  The Germans are relevant here because they tended to despise slavery, given how they viewed it in relation to the serf system of their homeland.  The border states generally attracted fewer Germans because of the legality of slavery; when they did settle in these states, the Germans by and large chose cities like St. Louis, Louisville, Covington, etc. for economic opportunities and because of a general identification with the culture.\n",

      "Crunch (AGT Crunch Acquisition, LLC) is a fitness-based enterprise that is focused on making entertainment an integral part of the exercise experience. Established in New York in 1989, today the Crunch brand has 27 locations in 7 major urban centers in the United States: New York City, Brooklyn, Atlanta, Chicago, Miami, San Francisco and Los Angeles. As a strategy, Crunch has concentrated on expanding inside of these urban centers: its penchant for innovation resonating especially well with the various demographics therein.  Because of these factors the brand is often associated with descriptors such as “hip”, “edgy”, “urban” etc. and has an air of inherent coolness that the majority of its competitors cannot claim to.\n",
      "\n",
      "FEATURES:\n",
      "\n",
      "1)TABGROUP FITNESS CLASSES\n",
      "Since its inception Crunch has maintained a focus on its group fitness program as the brand’s cornerstone. As such, it has built an extensive catalogue of classes that are characterized by their broad appeal and inventiveness. Numbering in the hundreds, these classes are organized into three different categories: Action Sports, Chill Outs and Dance Rhythms. Examples (taken from the official Crunch website) include:\n",
      "Urbanathlete (Action Sports)\n",
      "This circuit-style class is based on Men’s Health Magazine’s Fitness Challenge.  In it you’ll work through obstacles and exercises that were inspired by various cityscapes and come to see just about any sprawling metropolis as a big, concrete playground. \n",
      "\n",
      "Antigravity Yoga ‘Wings’ (Chill Outs)\n",
      "Wings’ will have you stretching further and holding challenging poses longer, using only a fabric trapeze to do so.  And, by employing simple suspension techniques you’ll move into poses that are seemingly impossible.  However, the goal isn’t just to turn you into a human pretzel: those poses will help to relieve compressed joints and align your body from head to toe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cardio Dance Blast (Dance Rhythms)\n",
      "Get your groove on in this sixty-minute class that’s been cleverly disguised as a dance party – one with a soundtrack comprised of the best in hip-hop, reggae and top-forty music.  You’ll melt away fat while bringing your dance skills to the next level and beyond.\n",
      "In addition, Crunch offers private versions of their classes for small groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "2)TABPERSONAL TRAINING\n",
      "Each Crunch location has a staff of personal trainers available to its members for individual or semi-private sessions. Crunch divides these personal trainers into four different categories based on experience and certifications earned. (All of Crunch’s personal trainers are required to have a minimum of professional experience and certifications earned prior to being hired.) Collectively, these trainers have expertise in a broad range of areas. Quoting from the company’s press kit, “All Crunch clubs are staffed with first-rate fitness professionals – personal trainers with certifications in a wide variety of specialties: strength training, yoga, boxing, kickboxing, pre/post natal, kettle bells, physical rehabilitation and much more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "3) EQUIPMENT\n",
      "All Crunch locations feature a wide array of fitness equipment produced by the industry’s leading manufacturers: Precor, Life Fitness, Netpulse, Expresso, Icarian, Hammer Strength etc. This equipment is updated with an eye toward keeping current with emerging technologies and trends. For example Crunch is phasing in Life Fitness’ treadmills with built-in iPod functionality. Select Crunch locations in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles feature Pilates studios equipped with both Reformers and Wunda Chair Systems and locations in all markets feature Yoga studios. Additionally, certain facilities have more elaborate features: full-sized boxing rings, swimming pools, indoor tracks, basketball courts, saunas, hot tubs and sundecks.  \n",

      "Request For Mediation In Removing Mclellan and The Marine Corps From Manookian's Page [Armenian Issues]\n",
      "I have tried to informally resolve the editing issues on Arman Manookian to no avail. As a matter of fact, I requested mediation with no response. Moreover, a consensus of Assisting Editors informed me, when I tried to include Arman Manookian on the List of Historically Notable Marines, that Arman Manookian was merely a clerk and nothing more and did not warrant such inclusion and was not part of Marine Corps History. Based on that guidance, I deleted references to McClellan [a Marine Corps Historian] on Manookain's page. Now, I note, the very same editors who opined that Manookian did not warrant inclusion on the List of Historically Notable Marines, insist on including McClellan's name and the Marine Corps on Manookian's page for propaganda purposes. I have repeatedly pointed out that this type of inclusion detracts from Manookian's accomplishments independent of the United States Marine Corps History. It appears as though a double and convoluted standard applies and it is very offensive to Armenians. Moreover, 3 linked references to McClellan and the Marine Corps confuse the readers as to who really the article is about. Is it about Manookian or Mclellan or the United States Marine Corps? Although I am assuming Good Faith, several witnesses are absolutely dismayed at this type of conduct and it should be noted that it gives the appearance of Bias for a POV and propaganda. I don't believe Mediation is consistent with an Editing War. Moreover, as I stated before in assuming Good Faith, it appears as though Manookian's page is being collaborated to sell art and recruit for the Marine Corps. Yet when simple solutions are offered, such as including Manookian and McClellan on the List of Historically Notable Marines, it is ignored because his last name ends in IAN and the fact that he committed suicide as a self imposed martyr. Despite the fact that on the Editor Assistance page the question posed was not answered and then listed as answered, I followed the guidance of those editors who in essence stated that the reason Manookian was taken off the List of Historically Notable Marines was because he was a clerk and McClellan only said nice things about [his name and fame are intertwined with it [Marine Corps History]] him because he felt sorry that Manookian committed suicide and not because he had anything to do with him being the first Marine Corps historical artist/illustrator. I followed their guidance and hope you follow their guidance as well.  This type of conduct cannot stand and it will be noted or publicized. Moreover, there seems to be a concerted effort by so-called volunteer editors who have a keen eye either on my edits or on Marine Corps History that have a problem with historically notable Marines whose last names end in IAN or who volunteered for suicide missions. Apparently, it has something to do with recruitment of Armenians for Martyrdom during WWII and the Marine Corps' subsequent treacherous conduct of ignoring those very same Armenian American Marines for political and financial reasons. At this point I ask that an administrator watch this page very carefully as it relates to an Armenian American Marine who cannot defend himself from scavengers.   00:44, 10\n",

      "Andy, thank you very much! )  What are the locations of those lost buildings?  All in Aachen?  I was wondering if the Holy Roman Empire was supposed to be inclusive for the whole of Western Europe, such as unofficially having traditionally independent places as England and other Catholic lands as subdivisions during that time.  The reason being, that there was only one emperor during those times(in the West) and only after Protestantism did multiple emperors become a feature of Western Europe.  Was the King of England a Sovereign during the time predating the Anglican schism, or was he subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor?  I postulate this, due to the fact that the Cardinals and Archbishops were subordinate to the Pope and figured that there's some part of history not being told to enough children.  Wouldn't that be a reason to break with the Vatican back then?  Once Henry broke with the Church, he was able to incorporate Wales and the Royal House changed from province to surname.  I was thinking that the provincial royal house like Anjou, Blois or Normandy is a Continental style.  Once England broke away, they went to personal names like Tudor and Stuart...even though Henry was technically of the House of Richmond.  Once England had become the center of another empire, just of its own, they reverted to usage of provincial houses.  So, what do you think...Am I right?\n",

Yes, some time ago the entire article on multi-level cosmology was deleted, but I think the deletion was premature and was the result of the unorthodox explanations of the theory. So even though the full article has been deleted, there is no reason, in the interest of science, not to mention the multi-level cosmology in other sections, and let others decide whether or not it is valid. Censorship, inquisition and suppression of science is counterproductive and harms science. If you are so obsessed with censorship of Wikipedia, do you also censor the articles in Tampa Tribune?

An organised gang of roman catholic extremists based in several western countries are editing and manipulating almost every article related to Christianity. Many of them build up credibility stealthily, gained administratorship in wikipedia and then started working on their agenda.

Assyrian Christians who were more or less Iconoclasts and abhorred themselves from extreme forms of marian devotion, are presented in these newly edited articles as adhering to the Roman Pope.

      "a) Discrimination:: clear this list maybe hetergenous, but is clearly not indiscriminate. On the contrary, groups of Masons have discussed together and made certain decisions about their relations of amity with one another This is clear discriminate behaviour. As regards notability, clear the discussion about whether UGLE recognised the Rite of Memphis-Misraim in the 1850's clearly involved political decisions taking place in consequence of the Revolutions of 1848. Involving such key figures at Louis Blanc and Guiseppe Garibaldi, this is clearly highly notable people and events. And there has yet to be any serious discussion of the role of revolutionary freemasonry in the International Workingmen's Association, which will also of couse link us into the very contraversial figure of Mihail Bakunin. Onfortunately these issues are all far too notable.\n",

This means that Wikipedia is immedtiately functioning at the level of intertextuality - i.e. the information contained on a wikipedia pagelinks other pieces of text, from which peopel may infer facts or events existing outside language. I would further argue that teh distinction between original research are the difference between relying on publisjed sources and unpublished ones, institutional denioted by the separate organisation of archives and libraries. I agree with [User:ALR|ALR]] that the task is a bit daunting, however if we can entice the anarcho-capitalists who produced such wonders on teh anacrhism talk pages a while ago I am sure we can create a suitable masters carpet of information from which Mason and Cowan can freely, fairly and friendly learn from and inform their fellow sentient creatures who have access to the internet. \"\n",

VfD pages really aren't the place for me to be making lengthy arguments, so I'll respond to your points here instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, you should be aware that anonymous users who sign up for accounts just to argue about the article being voted on are still effectively anonymous users, and are still not going to have their votes counted.  At this point I think it is really too late for you to establish a history at Wikipedia that would result in your vote being counted.  Again I refer you to Wikipedia:Deletion_guidelines_for_administrators#Rough_consensus for this information.  (Anonymous authors who request that their articles be deleted are often given consideration, but not those who want them kept.)\n",
      "Whether they're specifically enumerated on What Wikipedia is not or not, articles about neologisms are not encyclopedia material.  Firstly, #2 on that page indicates that Wikipedia articles are not dictionary definitions, and as a neologism is just a particular kind of word, an article on a neologism is necessarily a dictionary definition.  Secondly, encyclopedia articles cannot describe neologisms because they cannot describe things that are as yet unestablished.  \"\"No-boo\"\" may or may not be a word with some currency today, but it remains to be seen whether it will become part of the language.  Once we can determine that the term has staying power and is culturally or historically significant—which time will likely not come for months or years—then we can write an article on it.  Or rather, we could, if it weren't going to be just a dictionary definition.\n",
      "If the article in question is not about a word but actually about an event called \"\"The No-boo Affair\"\", then it ought to be entitled No-boo Affair.  In that case, I would still vote to delete it, on the grounds that it is a news story.  Again, there is no evidence at this time that this news story is going to have any historical significance, and considering that the substance of the news story is \"\"the AP made a mistake; they said some people booed at a speech but really nobody did\"\", it seems very unlikely that it will ever have historical significance.  (You characterize the AP's error as a \"\"clear falsification\"\", but I see no evidence of malicious intent by the AP, and anyway it's still not an encyclopedia's job to document falsehoods by the AP.  If the AP has a history or pattern of such falsehoods, and it is well-documented by other unbiased sources, then we can make a note of it in Associated Press.)  If the term \"\"no-boo\"\" becomes well established—which, again, we will not know for months or years—then perhaps it will be appropriate for us to record this news story as the origin of the term.  Certainly, Wikipedia has articles on other recent news stories.  However, most are stories of definite historical signficance, and those that are not should also be deleted.\n",
      "Wikipedia wants articles on items that are currently in the news, yes.  In this case there are many things related to the story that people might want to look up.  If we didn't already have them, we could add articles on George W. Bush, William J. Clinton, West Allis, Wisconsin, booing, the Associated Press, the White House, the Republican National Convention, New York, etc.  But this \"\"No-boo Affair\"\" is not an encyclopedic topic in the news; it is a breaking news story.\n",

I've supported contexts, and information from Norwegian sources, which could be used for support for both views, as the purpose of the article is to give a correct view of the topic (I didn't have to mention \"\"the ideal-part or any of the fractions given in the Dispute noticeboard, or quote to give any context, as no one of the non-Norwegians users would ever find out anyway).  \"\n",

      "\n",
      "I'd like to point out that perhaps it's not useful or accurate to start a history article with a date 100000 BCE like this...  The reason why, in general, is that the study of history is typically restricted to the era of 'written records', as the Wikipedia article on \"\"History\"\" will even state.  There can be probably some fudging, because written records can date slightly earlier events or have relation to slightly earlier events.  In short, history and pre-history will be divided by written records.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please take a look at the wikipedia article on History of England, in that, the upper-right table indicates prehistory is before 43 BC, and history in the years after.  This date of 43 BC is generally due to Roman era records.  And again, (somewhere geographicaly closer to Japan) in the article History of China, the article begins by saying that \"\"The history of China is detailed by historical records dating back to 1500 BC\"\". \n",
      "\n",
      "I think it's a bit problematic and misleading to state that history began 100,000 years ago, because if by history you mean purely archaeological evidence, then why stop there?  History will blend right into pre-history, and then into archaeology, without any meaningful demarcation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There is the more casual usage of the word 'history', of course.  That is, history is just the sequence of all events from beginning to end.  In which case, the history of Japan goes back to the Big Bang and all time afterward.  But as an informative and scholarly Wikipedia entry, I think this article should be amended with something more accurate, more specific, referring to what is canonically defined as \"\"history\"\".\n",

Even here, there is lots of controversy as to whether Yamataikoku even existed because of lack of archaeological evidence.  The idea that we have any idea of the specific events of 100,000 BCE, as the word 'history' demands, is somewhat unreasonable.  Any comments?  \n",

As Gregalton has pointed out on the debt-based monetary system talk page, it's not like \"\"quilting\"\".  How money should be produced and distributed in the modern economy is (if you hadn't already noticed) a slightly contentious issue.  Contentious enough for the argument to be concluded with an assassin's bullet (at least according to some monetary historians).  The question is not my manners, which I acknowledge are non-existent, but whether someone should DELETE what I have written ON MY OWN TALK PAGE on this basis, and threaten ominously \"\"you will not be warned again\"\" (I'm now reflexively turning around all the time to check how long Coren's knife is).  Instead of deleting and threatening, how about editors take the time to make constructive comments and suggestions to amend the text?  I can live with not being liked.

      "I honestly believe, and I've said this before, that there is a way of resolving this question. And the reason I believe it is because I believe that there has been a big misunderstanding about who Christopher Michael Langan is, and what he stands for. I would like to make two points.\n",
      "To be an advocate of something means to advocate for it. That is, it means to argue for it publicly. (One could be a private advocate around the dinner table, I suppose, but to argue this in an encyclopaedia would need very good evidence.) So, if somebody is an advocate, there should be clear evidence that he advocates the thing of which he is an advocate. Being an advocate means something different from, and something more than, being a member of an organisation. If it has been so difficult to find the clear evidence Langan advocates ID, that should give editors pause for thought, even those editors ill-disposed to the man.\n",
      "I believe the reason this evidence has been so difficult to locate is because Langan is not an advocate of ID. He is just not an advocatory kind of guy, if I may be permitted to put it like that. He is a very individual, probably very self-preoccupied sort of person. Contrary to how he has been presented, my impression is that he is anything but a self-promoter. He certainly is a guy who seems confident he is right about what he thinks, and would like people to listen to him. But that is not the same thing as being a self-promoter. More importantly, he comes across as somebody who is not at all interested in joining political movements, and is, in general, not a \"\"joiner\"\" of any kind. I truly believe that, as a guy totally outside academia, he was happy to receive the offer to speak at the ID conference, and could see grounds whereby what he had to say pertained to the interests of ID proponents. And the ID proponents, for their part, and as anti-ID people must surely recognise, are happy to accept into their fold anybody who seems like they could help the cause. So it was, if you like, a man and a movement taking mutual advantage of each other. Additionally, and as I have argued many times now, Langan's CTMU is disqualified from being a species of ID theory, because it explicitly disavows scientific proof, the very opposite of ID theory, which constantly tries to claim scientific testability. Langan, I honestly believe, is just not the kind of guy he has been taken for by anti-ID editors. And that is probably why the evidence just does not seem to be there.  \"\n",

No cellphone for him either. They also keep on adding features for the same price or dropping in price for the basic stuff.

As the principal founder and keeper of copies of written records concerning many such events, I though it would be useful to pass along some of that detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "The particular events I commented on concerning Richard Stallman were the product of Symbolics’ employees still using computers in the MIT AI Lab.  Our employees had begun to notice that software which they had authored and placed under the Symbolics' copywrite notice had started showing up in the software released to other licensees but without the Symbolics copywrite notice.  One of our employees, Dave Andre, extracted MIT Lisp machine screen session copies from various Lisp machines in the AI Lab and found that Richard Stallman had been the one removing the Symbolics copyrights and giving our software to the other Licensee, LMI.  Andre made paper copies of the incriminating screen sessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "These paper copies and the above explanation were presented to me by Dr. John Kulp, our VP of R&D.;  When John and I presented paper copies of these screen sessions to the AI Lab Director, Prof. Patrick Winston, and insisted that he stop his employees from breaking copyright law, he called Stallman in and barred him from entering the AI Lab and from using its computers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Richard Stallman and Richard Greenblat, as I recall, took the position that although the MIT Lisp Machine technology license under which Symbolics, Inc. and Richard Greenblat's company had obtained their rights to use and sell the MIT technology, the “intent” of the license had been that enhancements would be shared freely among licensees and MIT.  Of course, when I negotiated that license, I had intended and stated carefully in the license that licensee produced enhancements would be copyrighted and not made available to competing licensees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greenblat had represented the AI Lab as well as his own company, LMI, during the negotiation for the license which both LMI and Symbolics ultimately executed.  Wording to express this particular issue had caused Greenblat considerable difficulty but he had been forced by the MIT administration to accept it just as Symbolics wrote it so he knew well what was intended and that the intent had been clearly expressed in the signed licenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "This incident played a key roll in causing Stallman to spin out of the AI & Lisp field and to tackle creating a public domain copy of Unix.  Gifted as he is, my colleagues and I feel it is useful for people to know what motivated Stallman’s change in course of action and to get a sense of how opposed he was and may still be to conventional business and business law.\n",

One on \"\"Self Identity\"\" and using external objects to identify one's self, and \"\"External Memory\"\" being stored memories and information. Here are my reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Self Identity:\n",
      "In \"\"Stand Alone Complex\"\" Episode 25, Batou says to Kusunagi about her watch \"\"No matter how many prosthetic bodies you went through, this was the one thing that was always ticking away the same time as you, right? In this time that's far too fleeting, people entrust memories to external devices because they want to set down proof that can identify them as a unique individual. For you, isn't that watch the one external mnemonic device that can identify the person you've been up until now?\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This says that external mnemonic devices are to create a sense of unchanging self in a world where you can switch physical bodies on the fly. As biological humans our forms are fixed and unchanging for the most part and our self identity is tied deeply with that. In the GiTS universe, that is not true and you must tie your self-identity to external objects such as a watch or weight training to distinguish yourself from the rest of the identical mass produced cyborg bodies and create a sense of individuality. There are references in SAC 2ng Gig Episode 8 about cyborg food satisfying the brains cravings and as a reminder of times before becoming a cyborg. In SAC 2nd Gig Episode 11 there is a store that keeps and maintains external mnemonic devices that remind their owners of their own personal memories. All of these \"\"external mnemonic devices\"\" are used to trigger memories in one's self, but can not relay detailed information to a stranger.\n",
      "\n",
      "External Memory:\n",
      "External Memory is exactly that, memories and experiences that are stored \"\"offline\"\" onto a hard disk or such. If you posses a cyber brain, there is a definite separation of mind and body since your brain case can be removed and put into a new body. Since there is an electronic separation, the signals received from the senses (touch, taste, etc.) can be recorded and replayed at any given time. Thus, you could record important events such as your wedding day and replay it as if you were actually there anytime you wish. Your external senses turn off, and you’re fed recorded sensory information. Better than any video camera recording, your feeling the heat of the sun, the breeze, your brides’ hand trembling as you slip the ring on her finger, etc. Storing these memories also allows others to play them back and experience them as well. This would be a highly valuable technology for all areas of use; fully immersive gaming and movies, virtual business meetings that feel completely real, instantaneous access to wikipedia anywhere. In SAC 2ng Gig Ep 23, Batou talks about using Kusunagi's external memories to keep Gohda talking in Ep 22. He also talks about peeking at her external memories regarding Kuze. In SAC Ep 10 Ishikawa experiences Batou's memories from the murder scene. SAC Ep 21 the whole team replays Togusa's memories from the Sunflower Society office when he was shot.\n",

When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the U.S. went to war with Japan, but it also went to war with Germany and Italy.

      "Yaron Matras, non-Romani Professor in Linguistics at the University of Manchester, with the username  keeps adding the mention that the Ḍom -> Rom theory is the mainstream, an obvious personal POV. Yes, it has anteriority as compared to Rajput -> Rom theory, but is certainly no mainstream. It was based simply on the assumption of a name similarity and a supposed similar low status. The fact is that these two assumptions were mostly based on the anti-Romani stereotypes and prejudices. There are plenty of possibilities of making connections between the word Rom and words from the Subcontinent  and also the peculiarities of the Romanipen do not suggest at all a low caste origin. Plus, the name Domba itself in the Subcontinent do not designate a specific ethnic group, it is just an exonyom given by the hight caste to some unrelated groups that have their own ethnic names. On these grounds this theory is dismissed as unscientific. And if it finds supporters mostly among non-Roma, as fitting their ideas about Roma, this does not mean it is mainstream. The other theory is obviously well represented worldwide.\n",

It is sad that he resorts to such cheap intimidations, probably fitting himself the image of those non-Romani researchers who \"\"seem to feel threatened by Romanies who are educated or who are branded as ‘activists,’ as though this were automatically a bad thing\"\" as presented by Ian Hacock at Romani Origins and Romani Identity: A Reassessment of the Arguments. Is this a new proof that the Romani studies done by some non-Romanies are some of the last contemporary studies made in a colonialistic style?  \"\n",

      "First of all the Kurdish flag is allowed in Iran, but is not sanctioned publicly. Kurds have it in their homes and are allowed to have them. It is certainly not criminal in Iran for Kurds to have the Kurdish flag or symbol as many of my friends do. So edit your statement about it being criminal in Iran. Need I remind you all, that Kurds are ethnic Iranians and have historically enjoyed the greatest liberties in Iran as opposed to the mainstream discrimination Kurds face in Syria, Iraq, and Turkey?  \n",
      "It is usually Israeli sources, with increasing American and British help and aid, that intentionally falsely claim that the Kurdish flag (which fly the Pan-Iranian colours as does the unofficial flag of the Azerbaijani people and the flag of Tajikistan) is prohibited in Iran. FLYING THE KURDISH FLAG IN IRAN IS NOT CRIMINAL AS IT IS MENTIONED BY ISRAELI SOURCES. \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, I go on to read that there was research done that basically proves Kurds and Jews are genetically the same. It seems to me that certain individuals who I can see are Israeli are following the Israeli states policy of editing articles in lines with current events in the Middle East. Kurds are Iranians just as how Russians, Serbs, Poles, and Bulgarians are all Slavic peoples. Israel, the USA, and Britain are trying to create conflict in Iran as was done in the former Yugoslavia by creating problems along ethnic lines. This is called ‘balkanisation.’ The Israelis are doing this covertly through operations in Iraqi Kurdistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Propaganda for dividing and conquering people starts with definitions then the manipulation of history. I am an academic in the fields of anthropology and history and an Iranian from a minority group that is neither Persian nor Kurdish.

I am alarmed by the current purging of internet articles that have hidden agendas trying to separate the Iranian identity of Kurds. \n",
      "\n",
      "As I was told by a Kurdish professor, Mr. Eskandari in Tehran: “Kurds are Iranian and the entity of Iran as a state and nation was founded by the [main] ancestors of the Kurds, the Mede who established Iran as an empire. One problem that has compounded the issue is that people misuse the term Persian and Iranian. Persians are Iranian, but all Iranians, like the Kurds and Ossetians, are not Persians.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mede and other similar Iranian groups are the ancestors of the Kurds, but not the only group, just like how the ancient Persians are the main ancestors of the modern Persians, but not the only ancestors. Ancestors of Persians and Kurds also include Arabs, Mongols, and other Iranian peoples. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ask all the honest people on this site who wish to enhance knowledge not to take part in this fabrication of fact. There was a time when the Turkish government tried to convince Kurds that they were “Mountain Turks” and now there are powers at play that are either trying to disassociate the Kurds from their Iranian identity and origins or make whole generations of proud young Kurds forget or be unaware of their Iranian ethnicity. This is due to geo-strategic schemes. These forces are trying to victimize a whole group of people from knowing their own proud history and culture which is genuinely Iranian. The covert foreign policy of Israel, Britain, and America comes at the expense of the Kurds and even their history and culture.\n",

Sigismund I wanted the Prussian cities to give up their right to mint coins.

      "I think it would be more accurate to say, the revised outline seems to resolve the sensationalist approach of the old version. However, and this is what will take the time, the old version does have merits which should not be lost. There is an energy among some people to show that Berezovsky is a mafia-like boss. When I told a friend about Berezovsky and the accusations of his involvement as such a boss and how I would like to email him and ask him to donate a picture for the article, my friend expressed shock and dismay that I would risk my life so. The article needs the balanced outline of the revised version but should deal with both sides of the view of him. This balance is what takes the time. I would enjoy helping. Your energy for the article is obvious. If we could get an editor who wants to portray Berezovsky as a mafia boss to agree to the balanced outline and then to enter some careful rules of collaboration, the article could strengthen quickly. In the article I am working on presently, one other editor is active and he is very critical. But, he and I have finally agreed to work with the talk pages and to talk more civilly with each other and things are progressing much better. Similar cooperation could happen for the Berezovsky article. Rely on Secondary Sources. Insist on a conservative, scholarly examination of all aspect of Berezovsky's life. And, yes, I still want to email him, ask him for a picture, and perhaps go for coffee. )      \n",
      "Dear DonaldRichardSands, thank you for your input. Of course, Mr. Berezovsky is a highly controversial person, and I think, all these controversies are reflected in the revised text. But he is a major figure, who influenced Russian political history over two decades, and his biography deserves professional approach not only for his own sake, but for the sake of the whole Russia block on Wikipedia. With respect, the belief of \"\"some people\"\" that Berezovsky is a mafia boss is an opinion, which is not supported by facts. If an opinion is poorly sourced and potentially libelous, it has no place on Wikipedia, regardless of how many people may hold it. Otherwise we should change the rules and make Wikipedia a collection of opinions supported by a majority vote. Under current rules, we should work with well sourced facts. The facts in this matter are as follows. (1) That particular opinion has originated from a single source (Mr. Klebnikov), whose antisemitic bias has been noted by three respectable independent sources. (2) The publication (Forbes), which printed his opinion has unequivocally retracted it as lacking any evidence in a libel court hearing. (3) Dozens of profiles of Mr. Berezovsky in major world newspapers, which adhere to the standards of fair and responsible journalism - including serious Russian sources - do not repeat these allegations. I believe that Wikipedia should adhere to the same standards. The revised article states the sourced facts as they are: there was an opinion voiced, which was then discredited. Of course, if anyone can quote another reputable source, which supports this opinion with evidence, it should be mentioned. Since I am going on vacation, I have put the revised text on the main page, and leave it for the community to compare it with the previous version (which can be accessed via History tag), amend, challenge and comment - as long as it is done by the rules. The last thing I want is another edit war. On the other hand, seeking consensus is just one of Wikipedia rules. Avoiding pushing opinions, and removing unsourced slander is another.  \"\n",

      "Actually, Nin Einne is right. I'll try to explain why. First thing: all scientific information (i.e. somewhat accurate info...) should be publically verifyable, where verifyable means that one can check whatever is claimed, and public refers to the fact that anyone can do that. Now, if you cite some source, like in the example above, it says \"\"blah blah near daily\"\"(citation number). Unlike what you might think, that does not mean that the sentence \"\"blah blah near daily\"\" is a universally accepted fact  as proven by the fact that you have another opinion. What the phrase \"\"blah blah near daily\"\"(citation number) actually means is \"\"in (citation number), someone claims blah blah near daily\"\", which, you'll agree, is fully correct. After all, that is what's written there and anyone can look at the source (because it's public) and read what is says (verifyable). Now, if you think that blah blah occured daily an not near daily, that is fine. But how should you go about it ? One thing you can not do: change the sentence and leave the citation! Because then it would mean: \"\"in (citation number), someone claims blah blah daily\"\". That is not true! If you look at the source, you'll see it says \"\"blah blah near daily\"\"! Which is just what Nil Einne pointed out. Of course it can happen that what's written in the source is not accurate. But that doesn't mean you have the right to change it as you did.\n",
      "What you can do is add another source that contradicts the first one. You could write It has been reported that \"\"blah blah near daily\"\"(citation number), but I think that \"\"blah blah daily\"\". The moment you do this, however, you'll find that people will object, because what you have presented is not publically verifyable. So, what is needed here is a source, a pointer to publically verifyable information, to support your claim. The full list of newspapers would be ok, but very unpractical. If there is a single list somewhere, preferably produced by a fairly neutral source such as United Nation observers of something equivalent, that would be much easier.\n",
      "You might think it's much more important to tell the truth accurately, even if you don't find a source, because, after all, the truth is what it's all about. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as the truth, a universally and unanimously accepted version of events, and certainly not in the Israelian-Palestian conflict. Imagine for a moment that everybody would put their version of the truth on the page, and what the page would then look like! So, we are bound by certain rules that allow us to govern information about events without spiraling into chaos, and these very rules that exist to create accurate information state that sticking to the rules is more important that providing accurate information. Strange as it may seem, it works: even when not perfectly accurate, the result will not stray to far from the truth, if there is any one such thing, and that result is usually a fairly useful document as opposed to a flamewar.\"\n",

First, the use of the word \"\"promote\"\" is almost exclusively used in what would be considered a \"\"positive\"\" sense, and Landmark among others does not think of itself as a religion, so that description isn't necessarily \"\"positive.\"\" Also, as I think can be seen, the Human potential movement which Landmark is generally a part of is counted as a new religious movement, whose name strongly implies \"\"religious\"\" nature but only implicitly, and in fact est is listed in the List of new religious movements I helped put together based on the articles contained in encyclopedic sources on NRMs I found. So there is in my eyes no real reason for really questioning est's inclusion as a NRM. In response to  if you have any sources available to help improve the article, or which might be useful in determining which article we should use as the primary article on this topic area, any input would be more than welcome. So far as I can tell, Landmark has pretty much said that they were initially using the est approach, although they have admitted to changing it subsequently (I'm not sure how much, or if they've ever specifically indicated in what ways). So it might be that something like Landmark Forum or some similar title might be the best main article for the topic of the seminars as a whole, with specific information on the various groups and companies related to it in articles on those topics. Maybe. This is a bit of an active controversy around here, and the topic area has recently been reviewed by ArbCom because of its contentiousness, but if you have any sources availableor other input which you think might be useful we would all welcome seeing them.   \"\n",

My concern would be that someone in the future starts making sweeping changes (read: deletions) based on IDONTLIKEIT with the BLP as their smokescreen justification. I don't think that's your intent, but at some point it could happen from another. I'm hoping we all can mitigate that possibility now. Thanks in advance for clarifying.  •   •  • \"\n",

Also every country had a revolution and they are still alive today. The Muslim brotherhood in Syria is weak, even weaker than the islamist prescence in Libya. The rebels in Libya had 80-90% support, as we see now, and yet could hardly take control without NATO. What chance does the Syrian Muslim brotherhood have? None. If anything, nonviolent protests weaken the resolve of the Muslim brotherhood, making them less of an influence in the everyday life of Syrians.

      "I've never before seen someone else write about an \"\"American ethnicity\"\" the same way I have thought about it. I know that the Southeast has the greatest number of people declaring their ethnicity as American, but I think this ethnic label would apply to the majority of racially White Americans and not just those in the Southeast. The Americans (outside of the South) that descended from pre-20 c. immigrants from the UK, Ireland, and Germany seem to have substantially = meshed together into a \"\"White ethnic group\"\", not just racially, but ethnically as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only cultural differences between ethnic Whites of the North (where 19c. immigrants mostly settled) and those of the South is that the South still experiences religion and social conservatism as very influential forces on daily life. Where for the more recent ethnic Whites, this is not the case (e.g. in the North). So, the distinctive cultural aspects of the South have not been adopted by the ethnic Whites of the North even with several centuries having passed. I do not want to make false generalizations, however this is my sense of the average situation in those regions based on my travels and time spent living here. \n",
      "\n",
      "The areas where distinct ethnic identity has been conserved is in the major cities. The city-centred ethnic groups in the US have preserved a substantial part of their culture in absence of preserving their language (for the most part). A few well-known examples would be the Irish- and Italian-Americans of the Northeast. So long as their numbers are high enough to have a large enough community - cultural traditions endure. What I am getting at is that so long as a Ukrainian-American stays in a major city s/he has no reason to be forced into completely adopting a new ethnicity. S/he won't have to abandon the culture of his/her community. If s/he were to move to an area in the Southeast, then it would be a completely different story. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'd like to give you a further illustration - the Poles of Chicago. Most arrived somewhere between the 1850s and 1940s or so. Many have had families there for well over a century. There has been very limited migration out of Chicagoland for this period and the Polish community there has remained extremely strong. So there is not much past observation that would suggest that cities are only an entry point from which ethnic communities later break-down as they go their own ways. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've written all of this to demonstrate how the \"\"ethnic Americans\"\" and people who ethnically (not racially, but ethnically) identify as \"\"White\"\" are distinct ethnically from the more recent (post-1850) European ethnic communities in the major cities. I find it all very interesting. The only problem that sometimes arises is when individuals do not make the distinction between an \"\"Ameican\"\"/\"\"US citizen\"\" and an \"\"ethnic American\"\" and in so doing sometimes end up labeling certain individuals as being un-American. These people, that do not make the distinction, show frustration when a person does not abandon his/her culture and adopt their own. This is of course on an individual-by-individual basis and I would not generalize this in any way to any region or sub-region.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've seen ethnic hostilities projected towards myself or family/friends from people of all sorts of backgrounds. I've seen it demonstrated by Southerners, New Yorkers, and even Jews in South Florida. By the way, most of the time my ethnicity (and that of family/friends) would have been indeterminable by those people. I'm saying this because I don't want to suggest that any particular regional group of Americans is more racist/discriminant than another region. I've spent a lot of time in South Florida and the racist attitudes that come from some of the people there have been really surprising at times especially when you take into account that many of those racists that I have come across would themselves been the target of racism less than 50 years ago. Its all unfortunate and these types of racist, discriminatory, and nationalistic attitudes are probably present in most countries. \n",

      "Umm - I'm not exactly \"\"promoting\"\" him.  I'm a Democrat, and I voted for Gore.  But the consensus of several users - in fact, EVERY user except you - was very clearly in favor of the quote being removed from the introduction.  The quote provides no context, is blatantly POV, not to mention terribly inaccurate and silly, considering what actually happened with the election fraud (see http://www.commondreams.org/views04/1104-36.htm) and the fact that Gore actually won anyway.  So how did he make Dubyah the president?  Yes, I'm aware that's the first thing many people think of when they see him, just as the first thing many people think of when they see Mama Cass is that she died choking on a ham sandwich.  This, like the quote, is not true at all, but merely an ill-researched fallacy.  Does this mean we should write in Cass' introduction that she is best known for having choked on a ham sandwich?  No, because it simply isn't factually based or accurate at all. Even if it was accurate, it still wouldn't be appropriate for the introduction as it provides no context. Pretend you are someone who didn't know anything about him, and you saw this quote that he \"\"made George W. Bush the president\"\"-what would that mean? Is he the magical fairy who goes around granting wishes and making people president with his magical fairy wand from Lollypopland? You need to provide context and a detailed account of what actually happened before you provide such a glib, not to mention factually inaccurate, summary. As I said before, I've reviewed Toes+umbrellas chacha's edits, and none of them appear to be vandalism, but a pretty good faith attempt at removing something which not only constitutes a huge violation of NPOV policy, but also violates the consensus as reached on this talk page months ago.  So again, I don't know what your point is about that user being banned, when the offense seems to be only the fact that they removed vandalism well over 3 times.  To me, your offenses of violation of NPOV, violating consensus when no one agrees with you, and editing other user's sigs seem a twinkle more extreme than theirs.  I invite everyone to look at the comments that Griot left on Astruc's talk page wherein he revealed his very clear bias on this issue-he accused Nader of being a \"\"Maoist\"\"-and he is clearly just using Wikipedia as his own personal coloring book to slander him in violation of NPOV policy, and in violation of an irrefutable consensus on this issue.   \"\n",

Also I think, but am not cetrain, that the actual charges are made in a more general wordings, more making references to several legal clauses. And that, if the interogation goes to a legal case, the actual wording of the charge then would be more specific, as one of the aim of the \"\"prestudy\"\" is for the prosecuter to be more certain of what legal cluses to persue.

The whole world revolves like a cycle in the form of the digit zero. The Britishers dicovered an ancient egg of Dinosaures in India. What I mean to convey is that: India is the land where Lord Rama or Lord Krishna were born. Lord Rama was an example of a perfect ideal man on earth. His life story is an example for an ideal man to follow. Lord Rama, Lord Lakshmana, Lord Bharata and Lord Shatrughana were four sons of King Dhasratha of Ayodhya. He was cursed to die from the pain of separation from his son by the blind parents of Shrawan Kumar. Kaikeyi the mother of Bharata wishes to send Lord Rama on an exile for a period of 14 years and wishes her son Bharata to be the King of Ayodhya. Lord Rama and his wife Sita and his brother Lord Lakshmana leave for forests outside the kingdom of Ayodhya. Lord Rama's brother Lord Bharata persuades lord Rama to return back but lord Rama refuses to return to Ayodhya against the wishes of his step mother Kaikeyi. But Lord Bharata returns to Ayodhya along with the sandals of lord Rama and places the sandals of his brother Lord Rama on the throne and rules the kingdom of Ayodhaya in the name of Rama. This shows the example of love between an elder brother and his younger brother. In the forest once a demon shurpanaka sister of King Ravana disuades Lord Rama to marry her, but Lord Rama tells her that he is already married and points towards his brother Lord Lakshmana who cuts off her nose and ears to show her ugly nature and character. Shurphanaka runs off and complains about Lord Rama and Lord Lakshamana to King Ravana of Lanka. King Ravana somehow manages to kidnap Goddess Sita the wife of Lord Rama in revenge to Lanka. Lord Rama grieves for his separation from his beloved wife Goddess Sita. Here the feelings of an ideal person in the form of lord grieving from separation from his beloved wife are beautifully described by Sage Valmiki who wrote the whole Ramayana. Sage Valmiki was a thief named Ratnakar who by the japam of Lord Sri Rama became a great sage named Valmiki and wrote a great epic called Ramanaya the story of King Rama and Sita. Lord Rama and Lord Lakshamana move towards southern India where they meet the lord Hanuman, (the great son of Anjani and Kesari; Lord Hanumanji is also known as Pavanputra or the great celibate bachelor) and Lord Sugriva and with the help of vanara sena or Army of Monkeys they move into the kingdom of Lanka and kill the demon king Ravana. Lord Rama rescues Goddesses Sita and with the help of Lord Hanuman they return back to Ayodhya. A fourteen years had lapsed when lord Rama had left the kingdom of Ayodhya. When lord Rama, Goddesses Sita, Lord Lakshmana and lord Hanuman return to Ayodhya, the people of Ayodhya cheer up and lit up the whole Ayodhya with Diyas in order to celebrate the victory and return of their king Lord Rama. The festival Dusherra is celebrated every year as a victory of good over evil as the demon Meghanad {the son of King Ravana},the demon Kumbhakarna {the brother of king Ravana} and the demon King Ravana of Lanka were killed by Lord Rama and Lord Lakshmana in order to rescue Goddesses Sita from her captivity in Lanka. And on the occassion of their return to Ayodhya the festival Diwali is celebrated throughout India every year with  great pomp and show of lights and crackers. Whenever some troubled minds read this story of Ramayana their minds gain peace and the self confidence is restored as their spirits become calm, pacified and brave in the troubled periods of time. The Epic Ramayana denotes the greatness of Supreme God Lord Rama as an ideal human being on earth.  \"\n",

      "The titling of this article has been difficult, as the \"\"myth\"\" it is about is not about the false idea that the Earth is flat (see Flat Earth), but of whether there was a general belief in that false idea in Europe during the Medieval Period. I invite comment on whether \"\"Myth of 'Flat Earth' belief\"\" would be a better title.  ~  (talk) \n",
      "\n",
      "Russell calls it the “modern Flat Earth Error” or just the “Flat Error” in Inventing the Flat Earth (1991). In a 1997 conference he then refers to it as “the myth of the flat earth” (no capitals anywhere). None of these variants convey what the actual error is, and of course the reason Russell doesn’t try is that a literally accurate name would be quite long, something along the lines of “the modern misconception of a medieval European belief in a flat earth”. “Myth of a 'Flat Earth' belief” isn’t horrible, but it’s still not likely to mean anything to someone who doesn’t already know what it’s supposed to mean, in which case we haven’t achieved anything by changing. Russell’s book title works better than any of these other attempts. Something along the lines of “Flat Earth concoction” would give less chance for someone to mistake the article as a description of the belief that the earth is flat, something that has already happened twice in just the call for a capitalization change.   \n",
      " Comment: We don't care if Russell likes to overcapitalize in ways that MOS:CAPS doesn't sanction (and the source cited above suggests that there's a \"\"myth of Russell's capitalization\"\" at work here. Heh.) WP has a convention of not capitalizing such labels, even for universally accepted theories.  \"\"Modern flat earth error\"\" is a good start toward settling on a WP article title that makes sense. This article is about a modern belief about pre-modern belief in a flat earth. How do we address that most clearly? Two previously mentioned possibilities were \"\"Modern misconception of prevailing Middle Ages' belief in a flat Earth\"\" (which has a possessive usage error), and \"\"Modern misconception of prevailing belief in a flat Earth in history\"\".  I think I'd go with: '' (with precisely that capitalization; see above RM, which can and should proceed in the interim to comply with WP:MOSCAPS, since this \"\"what should this  be titled\"\" discussion could drag out for who knows how long, if it ever gets resolved).  —  ☏ ¢ ≽ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ≼  09:\"\n",

The gall of some people is astounding: they've all become \"\"specialists\"\" when they can hardly follow the Greek literature - because if they did you would be (a) dismissing Ethnologue's 1986 crap outright and (b) quoting the V-PRC survey which is recent and despite an obvious flaw of assuming no pluri-lingual descent/ability is the most recent and extensive statistical country-wide survey of use/understanding of non-Greek languages and significant Greek dialects in Greece to-date. If you were a specialist you would know that the US SD's \"\"estimate\"\" is not the result of a survey (do you seriously believe that any type of similar survey by a foreign power into such a matter would have gone unnoticed and not being reported in the Greek media causing a diplomatic episode?) but the estimate based on visits to some parts of Macedonia (in Greece) of a certain diplomat (later to become infamous through a very public resignation) called Brady Keisling that single-handedly raised the profile of the issue in the SD's HR reports. If you were a specialist - instead of trying to guess numbers you would be giving the number of villages in which the language was spoken by at least some inhabitants according to the 1996 Euromosaic study (which your pal FPS has apparently read - but still has been unable to digest enough to add Arvanites in Thrace in his \"\"map\"\"). Then again you could do worse - your other pal Jim62sch seriously believes that you could have a non-government sponsored census (mind you not survey) in Greece (actually I wonder in how many developed countries can anyone other than the government \"\"convince\"\" people to stay home and open their doors for census takers to visit). Or that the results of such a private 1986 census would not become public until 2005! Maybe the evil Greek nationalists had a hand in that as well.

      "First off, I removed the reference to \"\"after Yanukovich fled the country\"\".  The term \"\"fled\"\" is loaded and POV.  To say he \"\"left\"\" the country is non-POV... but the statement added zero value in the first place.  Second, let's talk about some English language usage for all the Ukrainians on here, specifically the difference between literal and figurative language:\n",
      "\n",
      "Revolution:  \"\"A fundamental change in power or organizational structures that takes place in a relatively short period of time.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Coup:  \"\"The sudden and illegal seizure of a government, usually instigated by a small group of the existing state establishment to depose the established government and replace it with a new ruling body, civil or military.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me explain the difference clearly.  A revolution occurs when forces abolish government power structures.  This clearly did not occur.  A coup occurs when one faction of the government seizes control of the existing power structures.  This clearly did occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no revolution in Ukraine.  There was only a coup.  This position is non-POV and sustainable.  I recommend:  \"\"Maidan Coup\"\" or \"\"2014 Ukrainian Coup\"\"... but the term \"\"Ukrainian Revolution\"\" is both POV and misleading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note:  Above I use the literal definition of 'Revolution' to mean the violent overthrow of government power structures (e.g. the American Revolution).  Revolution also has a figurative definition of 'wide-ranging change' (e.g. the 'industrial revolution').\n",
      "\n",
      "  Applying a figurative term that is not literally true is necessarily POV.  For example, neither the \"\"Velvet Revolution\"\" nor the \"\"Orange Revolution\"\" were literal revolutions and their names are POV and misleading.  In both cases these monikers were coined by dissidents.  I recognize that these are the terms that are widely used to refer to these events and, having become widely recognized, are appropriate titles in Wikipedia.  That does not change the fact that they are POV.  Nor does it change the fact that, in this case, there is no widely recognized name for these events that would justify such POV naming.  I reiterate that the appropriate title is \"\"Maidan Coup\"\" or \"\"2014 Ukrainian Coup\"\"  173.79.251.253  \"\n",

that makes absolutely no sense...i even provide some sources from where i get my stuff from and still complain n harass?...you prob didn't even notice some of the edits there you see in even your edits and others  were done by ME lol, you just built upon it and added your own, i'm not saying you nor others taking credit for others work and research (i hope not that's just unprofessional and messed up) but you got something of a personal motive that you're not admitting to, if i'm doing the edits as best as i can and doing it the same way as you are and tryign to provide sources...what s the problem then? the stuff i get my info from are from credited  1st or 3rd party websites lol..what more do you need? the signatures of the editors of the other websites where i get my info from? come on now haha..why don't you be a little more honest and say what really is your problem with me instead of making escuses for it and when people confront you about it or want to speak their mind you back out...oh yeah that's very mature pal just because i don't believe in the same ideals as you ...i mean how can  an admin of such  \"\"REPUTATION\"\" be so naive..i don't get it..you don't like others to express their disapproval or speak their mind about how to improve an article  i mean this is what U r doing \"\"4 + X = 5\"\"..that's ok to you right ..missing information that you won't even bother to look up fully and this isn't a grammar class people make typos all the time big deal deal with it..this isn't a regular article its a talk page. i got my say as much as you do regardless of how long you have being editing here or your position here etc, i have a say as much as you do...if you can't take criticism of your poorly edited works than maybe you shouldn't be editing here in the first place..you have no seniority or control over me whatsoever..no one does as i don't have over you ...all i'm asking is for me do do things right and i'am i give u sources , i flesh out the articles n fill in the blanks ..what more do you want guy?...don't make arrogant excuses about my typos or so called ramblings just because you can't take being told in your face criticism in your work...the point is i COMPLETE the articles..you and others with your mentality don't finish it or bother to do a more thorough look..so don't make excuses for your wrong doings ..so you can't take criticism, you don't like other people's edits that re more complete and informative than yours unless you are the 1 editing them, you make excuses for people speaking their mind when they tell you things in your face that are mostly true but you aren't mature enough to own up to it, you make it personal...so if you or anyone who thinks like you don't think about it or made the effort than its BAD right? lol...who you think you are? god ? lol ....i try to be respectful and i want to be able to edit freely in my own way even though my versions are usually more complete , informative and thorough, i don't make up facts i don't troll or do things with bad intentions here..especially here because i rely in wikipedia  myself when i want to look up something just because you haven't thought it up or made the effort to be more thorough doesn't mean you or your kind with your mindset have to abuse their authority here because they weren't creative enough to come up wit h it themselves..like i said go ahead and make excuses about misspellings and ramblings because you hide under that to mask your own faults wish it was you who done it and thought it up\n",

(Insiders would recognize Berry Knoll as the \"\"juniper-covered hill south of town\"\" (Colorado City, Arizona/Hildale, Utah...) '' \"\"said to be the site for the temple the polygamous church had hoped to construct....\"\" one day.\"\")Banking on Heaven: \"\"In the FLDS (Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints), women are chattel and young boys are kicked out so older polygamous men can have sex with young girls. Everybody does what they’re told, because the prophet, Warren Jeffs, is God [...]]\"\"FLDS 101: \"\"The FLDS 'yearn for Zion,' to live in a society free from sin and contention, where all things are held in common without jealousy  a heaven on earth. As the FLDS leadership continued to prophesy that the end of the world was quickly approaching, they taught the people that wickedness needed to be purged from their society. Jeffs taught, 'One or two covenant breakers can cause the Lord to stop blessing this people. As long as we have evil doers among us, the Lord's blessings will be withheld. Zion must be pure. We can't have evil people among the priesthood for the Lord to appear and bless us like He would like to. Be this a warning.' (W.S.J. 12/26/95) Jeffs laid the doctrinal groundwork to justify a cleansing of the FLDS. Their theology teaches that an ancient city lead by a prophet named Enoch, was taken up into heaven because of their righteousness. The FLDS believe they can be taken up too as the wicked world is destroyed.\"\"[... ... \"\"Yearning for Zion,\"\" a hymn by W.S. Jeffs; 3rd verse]:Imagine the people of Enoch of old, trained in the order of heaven/ A beautiful city the Lord called his own and forever made his abode/ Coming to join with the Zion on earth when finally the earth finds its rest/ A kingdom established in celestial laws, a people the Lord can accept/ A New Jerusalem it will be, a land of refuge, a city of peace [ . . . ]\"\n",

I understand whatamidoing and Bilby are very experienced editors who have made great contributions to Wikipedia as editors. No-one is disputing that.

It is also about reality - and as usual, people here are trying to make Wikipedia into an alternative universe rather than an encyclopedia. So, in a nutshell, it doesn't really matter what any of you think. If you can produce a copy of this or any album where the numbering on side two is continued from side one, rather than beginning again from track one, by all means, it should be noted in the article, because that would be an accurate representation of how the record was presented to the public, as well as a reliable source. Problem solved. By arbitrarily deciding on a numbering system that is contrary to what actually exists in the real world, you are using original research, which some people here tend to frown upon.

I request that editors maintain an impartial approach when dealing with Christianity-related articles and other religious articles. I further request that editors acknowledge the polytheistic elements of the Christian faith, the controversy around the issue, and that Christianity believed to be polytheistic by some. \n",

      "It says in the American Encyclopedia (an academic accredited work): \n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"The belief in the Oneness of God – as a theological movement – began at a very early stage in history, and in fact it preceded the belief in trinity by many decades. Christianity developed from Judaism, and Judaism firmly believes that there is one God. \n",
      "\n",

      "The doctrine of trinity which was affirmed in the fourth century CE bears no resemblance to the original teachings of Christ concerning the nature of God.

      "Will Durant, in his The Story of Civilization says: \n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"When Christianity conquered Rome, the new religion (i.e., Christianity) was infused with the blood of the old idolatrous religion: the title of archbishop, worship for the great mother, and an innumerable number of lords who gave peace of mind and were like who exist in all places and cannot be detected with the senses. All of this came into Christianity as the blood of the mother comes into her child. \n",
      "\n",
      "The civilized empire handed over power and administration to the papacy and the impact of the word replaced the impact of the sword. The preachers of the church started to assume positions of power. \n",
      "\n",
      "Christianity did not put an end to idolatry, rather it reinforced it. The Greek mind came back to life in a new form, in the doctrines and rituals of the church. The Greek rituals appeared in the rituals of the monastic saints. From Egypt came the idea of the holy trinity, the day of reckoning, eternal reward and punishment, and man’s eternal life in one of the other. From Egypt also came the worship of the mother and child, the mystical union with God, the union which led to Platonism and agnosticism, and the erasing of Christian doctrine. And from Persia came the belief in the return of the Messiah and his ruling the earth for 1000 years. \n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the element of atheism in the words of Durant, which is something that he is known for, and which is apparent in his claim that the idea of eternal reward or punishment came from the Egyptians, tracing the origins of deviant idolatry in Christianity is no longer a secret, and he is not the only one who has researched them. In his book Christianity and Idolatry, Robertson states that Mithraism, which is a religion of Persian origin, flourished in Persia approximately six centuries before the birth of Christ, and it reached Rome around the year 70 CE, where it spread throughout the Roman lands. Then it reached Britain and spread to a number of British cities. What concerns us here about this religion is that it says: \n",

It is speculative why he did this although I again agree with pm_shef when he made the assumption it was to draw funds out of his municipal campaign fund, which seems like a reasonable reason to me.  I don’t know what the laws are on putting your name in for nomination while holding other office.  But this now seems to be a common practice here in Vaughan for example, Alan Shefman put his name in to run municipally in 2004 by-election (Councillor) while still holding another municipally elected position (school trustee), Susan Kadis did a similar thing in 2004 as well, running federally while still holding municipal office and Racco also did it in 2003 when he ran provincially while still holding municipal office.

The second is that translations are difficult and often there's a thin line between literal translations becoming unreadable to a modern reader, and interpretations that help with understanding the original texts.  There's many \"\"introductions\"\" to Aristotle that make this point.  Aristotle in outline By Timothy A. Robinson or Aristotle By Christopher John Shields make similar points, as does A new Aristotle reader By Aristotle, J. L. Ackrill.  The Clarendon translations are often cited as being a set of references translations, translates the passage as \"\"In this sea are situated two very large islands, the so-called British Isles, Albion and lerne, which are greater than any which we have yet mentioned and lie beyond the land of the Celts\"\".  Other translations are more literal - for example, early editions of Encyclopaedia Britannica state the following: \"\"The passage is in the De Mundo, c. 3,—\"\" Beyond*the pillars of Hercules (Straits of Gibraltar) the ocean flows round the earth, and in it are two very large islands called British (BperaviKal Acyo/ievcu), Albion and Ierne, lying beyond the Keltoi.\"\"  A similar translation is attributed to \"\"The General History of the Celts.
